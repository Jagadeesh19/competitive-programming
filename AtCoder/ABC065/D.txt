Assume a Graph where nodes represent the cities and edges represent roads between the cities.

The problem asks us to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

We can use the famous kruskals algorithm.

let m be the number of edges of the graph.

In kruskals algorithm out of m edges (n-1) edges are selected in greedy manner which works in O(mlogm)

In our problem we are given a complete graph (since road can be constructed between any two cities).
so m=n*(n-1)/2

So O(mlogm) is not ideal. So we need to filter the edges in given graph and then apply kruskal algorithm.

So Let's find out how to filter the edges of the graph.

let A(x,y) and B(p,q) be two nodes of  graph.

The weight of edge between A and B is min(|x-p|,|y-q|)

But instead of adding one edge we add two edges |x-p| and |y-q| (Since Kruskals algo will remove max edge anyway This
won't be a problem.)

We call |x-p|'s as x-edges and |y-q| as y-edges.

Now consider three points A,B,C ST Ax < Bx < Cx
We can see that we don't need to add an x-edge between A and C.

Using the above explanation we only need atmost 2*(n-1) edges (see below)

    1. sort all points(nodes) according to x-coord and consider x-edges only between adjacent vertices. (n-1) edges
    1. sort all points(nodes) according to y-coord and consider y-edges only between adjacent vertices. (n-1) edges

Now we have only 2(n-1) edges, now we can apply kruskal's algorithm on these edges.

Time Complexity - O(nlogn)
